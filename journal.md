1. Planning 
I have analyzed the project requirements that inclides responsive layout, HTML/CSS, JavaScript behavior, accessibility and beyond class component.
Checked on site structure- hero- about - Experience - Projects - Contact 

2. Implementation
I have built navigation, hero, About and timeline sections in HTML.
Added custom styling for timeline and spacing using CSS + Bootsrap
Created project cards with GitHub links.
Added accessible contact form with labels and proper for/id attributes.

3. JavaScript
Used ES6 for smooth scrolling, back to top button behavior and navbar auto-collapse.
These are included in script.js

4.Beyond class requirement
Added Bootstrap Accordian to show extended information in the Experience section.

5.Accessiblity fixes 
WAVE initially flagged form label and contract issue, i have fixed it with proper labels, black text for links and timeline 
Finally it showed 0 errors.

6. Testing 
I checked the responsiveness in browser.
Verified link contrast, navigation, JS interactions and form behavior.

7. Reflection
This project improved my understanding of semantic HTML, responsive bootstrap layout, ES6 JavaScript for interactivity and accessibility adjustments. Attention to contrast, labels, structure and user experience improved the code quality.
